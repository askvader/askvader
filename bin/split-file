{- Utility for splitting big .av files containing let-expressions.

  split-file x.av dir/

will split the file x.av and place results in dir/, thus:

- File is split after each \n that is the END of the last line containing code (e.g. not just WS or comments)
  immediately preceding a line starting with 'let'.
- The binding "let foo : T = E" places "let foo : T = E in foo" in the output file "foo.av"
- Each file is prepended by one let-line for each preceding definition
- Two output files including the whole package 'package' and 'Types' is generated for upper- and lowercase definitions respectively

    let X = Natural
    let foo = 1 : X
    -- About bar
    let bar = foo + 1
    in bar

becomes

./X
let X = Natural in X

./foo
let X = ./X
let foo = 1 : X in foo

./bar
let X = ./X
let foo = ./foo
-- About bar
let bar = foo + 1 in bar

./package
in { foo = ./foo, bar = ./bar }

./Types
let X = ./X
in { X = ./X }
